# ðŸ™‹ Request Access

The platform will go through a closed round of alpha testing before being released to the public. &#x20;

If you'd like to participate, you can request access by sending your handle either:

* via email, to [request@pmsky.social](mailto:request@pmsky.social),&#x20;
* or via DM to [@pmsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/pmsky.social).

Upon approval, your handle will be added to a whitelist, and you'll be notified when the platform is available to you.  Thank you for your interest!

All that's required is your bsky handle, but I'd also appreciate hearing things like:
- How did you find PMsky?
- Why do you want to try it out?
- What are you hoping the platform can do?
- And any other thoughts you might have!
