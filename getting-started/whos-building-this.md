# Who's building this?

The initial work for this project is being done by [Drew McArthur](https://drewmca.dev) ([@drewmca.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/drewmca.dev)).

For full transparency, this is part of my thesis for a degree in [Media and Public Engagement](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/ma-media-and-public-engagement).  A goal of my studies has been to explore how groups make decisions in the absence of leadership making decisions for them.  In this context, the question is how moderation can work in the absence of a privileged group of moderators. &#x20;

This should not create any conflict of interest, since the main requirement of the degree project is public engagement.  So long as this project is co-designed with the community it serves, I'll be satisfying those requirements.  Users of this platform will not be the subjects of any external research or publications.  The purpose of this project is solely to produce tools that are useful.
